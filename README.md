> [!WARNING]
> i say that it is a "silly" game engine because i have made it for fun, and it will never be a full-featured game engine like bevy or godot
> i am not a game developer, so use this engine at your own risk and expect bugs and missing features

## overview

_xpeto_ aims to be a code-first game engine, taking advantage of Go's simplicity and performance

the engine is built around [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/), a lightweight 2D game library for Go, and takes inspiration from the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine
